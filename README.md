# Spotter Personal Assistant

Spotter is being developed as a personal assistant that could track my progress, record my habits, and eventually help me improve my daily routines. 
At the moment it just records information and but eventual goal is to convert it into a guide for self improvement using proven self improvement techniques given by James Clear, BJ Fogg etc.
